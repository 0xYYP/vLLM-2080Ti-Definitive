# vLLM 2080 Ti Definitive Edition

The definitive vLLM runtime for dual RTX 2080 Ti / SM75 serving.

This is a hardware-focused fork that preserves the patched source, launch
profiles, and runtime notes needed to reproduce the working 2080 Ti vLLM stack.

## Why RTX 2080 Ti for LLM Inference?

In August 2018, NVIDIA launched the RTX 2080 Ti and moved the enthusiast GPU
line from GTX into the RTX era. Years later, the card is still remembered as a
landmark Turing design. With 22GB memory mods, NVLink, high memory bandwidth,
and enough raw compute to remain relevant, dual 2080 Ti cards turn out to be a
surprisingly strong local AI inference platform.

| Metric | 2x 2080 Ti 22GB + NVLink | 3090 Ti 24GB baseline | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Physical CUDA core count | 8,704 | 5,376 | 1.62x |
| SM count | 136 | 84 | 1.62x |
| Physical Tensor Core count | 1,088 | 336 | 3.24x |
| Dense Tensor FP16 matrix throughput | 228 TFLOPS | 160 TFLOPS | 1.43x |
| Total physical memory bandwidth | 1,232 GB/s | 1,008 GB/s | 1.22x |
| Total VRAM capacity | 44GB | 24GB | 1.83x |
| Secondary-market price anchor | about $550 with NVLink | about $1,100 | about 0.5x |

The project is built around a simple cost/performance bet: use roughly half the
secondary-market price of an RTX 3090 Ti to get a dual 22GB RTX 2080 Ti setup
that can match or exceed it on the physical resources that matter for LLM
serving, then use vLLM runtime work to turn those resources into real tokens.

That is the first value of this fork: take old but strong Turing silicon and
make it behave like a serious 27B/31B-class inference platform through Marlin,
FlashQLA/FlashInfer/FA2, TurboQuant/INT8 KV, MTP, and CUDAGraph integration.

Core feature matrix:

| Feature | Qwen-family 27B | Gemma4-family 31B |
|---|---|---|
| AWQ Marlin | 🟢 recommended weight route | 🔴 not current route |
| GPTQ Marlin | 🟢 recommended weight route | 🟢 recommended weight route |

| INT8 KV continuation fast path | 🟢 recommended MTP/capacity route | 🔴 not current route |
| YaRN 524K extension | 🟡 capacity/offline experiment | 🔴 not validated |
| No-eager/CUDAGraph noMTP | 🟢 recommended graph route | 🟢 recommended graph route |
| No-eager/CUDAGraph with MTP | 🟢 recommended graph route | 🟡 works, limited speed gain |
| Fast prefill path | 🟢 FlashQLA + FlashInfer/FA2 | 🟢 FlashInfer/FA2 with SDPA512 controls |
| Peak MTP=3 single-request PP4096/TG128 | 1841.7 / 101.3 tok/s | 1665.9 / 44.3 tok/s |

Target runtime:

- GPU: dual RTX 2080 Ti, SM75, tensor parallel size 2
- CUDA/PyTorch: CUDA 12.8, `torch 2.11.0+cu128`
- Base vLLM: `0.21.0`
- Repository identity: `vllm-2080ti-definitive`
- Main stable runtime identity: `vllm-sm75-tp2-cu128`

This fork is not a general upstream replacement. It carries local patches for
SM75/Turing serving, FlashQLA, FlashInfer, TurboQuant KV, INT8 KV continuation,
MTP/CUDAGraph safety, and Qwen/Gemma production profiles.

Important local docs:

- `docs/2080ti-stable/README-STABLE.md`: stable runtime contract and benchmark
  evidence.
- `docs/2080ti-stable/README-cu128.md`: CUDA 12.8 migration and validation log.
- `bench_tools/stable_profile.sh`: named model/profile environment presets.
- `bench_tools/remote_start_vllm_cu128.sh`: environment-driven launcher template.

## About

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has grown into one of the most active open-source AI projects built and maintained by a diverse community of many dozens of academic institutions and companies from over 2000 contributors.
